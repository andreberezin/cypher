	// 3. Allow the user to select the encryption type

	// 4. Allow the user to input the message to encrypt/decrypt

	// 5. Output the result of the operation
	// If user input is invalid, the program should keep prompting the user to input again, until valid input is provided. Before validatid the input, it has to be trimmed (remove whitespaces from the beginning and the end of the input).
	// When encrypting or decrypting, ensure that any non-alphabet characters in the message are left unchanged.
