1.  Explain what the tool does
    The tool either encrypts or decrypts a user inputted messages and outputs the message. The user can choose for the tool either to encrypt or decrypt and can choose also the type of encryption/decrytion done.
2.  Explains the usage of the tool, with example

        Welcome to Awais', PÃ¤rtel's and Andre's Cypher tool!

    Select operation:

    1.  Encrypt
    2.  Decrypt
        1
        Select operation:
    3.  ROT13
    4.  Reverse
    5.  Custom
        3
        Enter shift number:
        13
        Enter the message:
        Hei
        This is the encrytped message using custom encryption:
        Urv

3.  Explain the cyphers used
    Custom (Ceasar)
    For each alphabetic character, it calculates its shifted position in the alphabet by adding the shift value.
    If the shift causes the position to go beyond the range of the alphabet (more than 25 positions), it wraps around by taking the remainder when divided by 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet). This ensures that the shifted position stays within the alphabet range.
    Finally, it converts the shifted position back to ASCII representation by adding the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A', depending on the case, to get the correct ASCII value of the letter.
